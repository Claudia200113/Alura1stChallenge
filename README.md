The completed project is a text encryptor. The user can input a text, which will be encrypted, and they can also decrypt it if needed.
There are four main functionalities:
	1.	Encrypt text - Receives the user’s text and replaces the vowels with certain letters.
	2.	Decrypt text - Takes the already encrypted text and decrypts it so the user can see it in “normal” form.
	3.	Delete text - Removes the displayed text and resets the page to default.
	4.	Copy text - Copies the text from the result box to the clipboard, making it easier for the user to switch between encrypting and decrypting the input text.

Note: The encryptor only works if the input text does not contain uppercase letters and/or accents.
